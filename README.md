## Description
Financial fraud and money laundering have become increasingly sophisticated in the age of mobile banking and cryptocurrencies. This project aims to combat fraudulent activities in the banking industry through the application of artificial intelligence.

To better understand fraudulent transactions within the data, we have employed various visualization techniques. These visualizations help us gain insights into the characteristics and distribution of fraudulent transactions, enabling us to make informed decisions during the model development process.

Our approach involves the use of various AI algorithms and statistical methods implemented in Python to detect patterns indicative of fraudulent transactions. We plan to explore clustering algorithms, neural networks, Bayesian methods, and logistic regression to identify the most effective solution for our project. These models will be trained using simulated financial transactions from the Kaggle dataset, which comes with comprehensive annotations.

To assess the performance of our models, we will employ standard evaluation metrics such as accuracy, precision, and recall. Additionally, we will compare our results against a benchmark model's performance to gauge the efficacy of our approach.

## Outcome
Our ultimate goal is to develop a predictive model capable of identifying fraudulent transactions using real financial data. We aspire to contribute to the ongoing battle against financial fraud by leveraging AI techniques and innovative methodologies.

## Dataset
The dataset used for this project is available on Kaggle: [Paysim Synthetic Dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/ealaxi/paysim1). It provides a comprehensive collection of synthetic financial transactions, making it an ideal resource for training and evaluating our fraud detection models.
